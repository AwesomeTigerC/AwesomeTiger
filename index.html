  <center><h1>Guitars Difference 101<h1></center><h7>
  Guitars can vary and dramatically change from size to sound and even the feeling of the music. Many guitars can differ but they aren’t often used so the differences between electric, acoustic, and classic guitars are pretty unnoticeable. <p></p>
  To begin, the difference between the electric guitar and the classical guitar is the largest. One way that they are distinct is that the electric guitar has steel strings that can resonate and while the classical guitar has 3 strings made of nylon and 3 steel strings which give a more mellow and warm sound that can be calming. What’s more, to play the strings the electric guitar uses a chip that allows a consistent strong lead tone or a great beat. On the other hand, the classical guitar uses finger plucking to be able to change the volume and the strength of the music. Lastly, the electric guitar usually uses a large speaker that gives the sound more oomph. In contrast, the classical guitar mostly depends on the guitar soundbox. Without a doubt, the differences between the electric guitar and the classical guitar are very contrasting.<p></p>
	Although the electric and classical guitar has a large difference, the classical and acoustic guitar don't. They don’t have the same strings because the acoustic guitar has steel strings which are more consistent and resonates better than the nylon strings that the classical guitar has. Besides, both of the guitar types use the echo from the guitar body and they aren’t as loud as other types of guitars. Acoustic guitars can use both plucking and chips though most often, they use plucking which is easier. Classical guitars also majorly depend on using their fingernails to make a sound that feels welcoming. Thus, classical guitars and acoustic guitars aren’t unalike in some ways, but they do have unique differences as well. <p></p>
	Lastly, the differences between the acoustic guitar and the electric guitar. They have some similarities such as that they both have steel strings which make them a good lead guitars for bands. On the other hand, the acoustic guitar mostly depends on plucking with fingers while electric guitars use the chip way more than plucking. That means that electric guitars are louder even by themselves. Additionally, electric guitars have amplification systems like speakers and Amps, unlike the acoustic guitar which depends on the echo from the body of the guitar.<p></p>Furthermore, Acoustic guitars are used to play country, folk, and rock, but the electric guitar is used to play rock, blues, and jazz. Some of these types of music overlap. Ultimately, the electric guitar and the acoustic guitar are different in some ways but also the same in different ways. <p></p>
	In summary, guitars are different and similar in many ways, yet some characteristics can be subtle and unnoticeable. Overall, Guitars can be both the same and different in many ways.
